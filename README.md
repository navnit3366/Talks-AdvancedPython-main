# Library Development

A series of talks on library development, with example code.

More details, screencasts, and slides can be found at [talks.leeming.dev](https://talks.leeming.dev/).

I use the [Obsidian Markdown editor](https://obsidian.md/) with the Advanced Slides plugin to build my slides,
and export them to HTML, hosting the result at the above link.
